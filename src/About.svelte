    <h3>
      For new kendoka, this site is your starter pack to kendo language and
      etiquette
    </h3>

    <p>
      My name is Insiya Bambot, and Iâ€™m a senior pursuing a B.S. in Computer
      Science at UCLA. In addition to my studies, I'm serving as President of
      the UCLA Kendo Club for the 2020-21 school year. You can learn more about
      me

      Thanks to a certain pandemic, my education and extracurricular activities
      have moved online, and it's been a while since I and many others have
      practiced together in person. So I imagine it's difficult for those who
      are just beginning their kendo journey to pick up all the language and
      etiquette that they would normally be exposed to in the dojo. This site is
      my effort to introduce kendo's cultural nuances to these new kendoka while
      they learn to wield their shinai from home.
